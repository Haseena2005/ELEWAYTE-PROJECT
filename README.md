Major Project — General Health Prediction using Machine Learning:

📘 Overview:

This project predicts an individual’s general health condition using the CVD (Cardiovascular Disease) dataset.
It compares multiple machine learning models — Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest — to identify the best-performing classifier for health prediction.

🎯 Objectives:

Import and preprocess the CVD dataset

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

Train models using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest

Evaluate models using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

Compare model accuracies using a bar chart visualization

Apply Randomized Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning

Predict health status for a single user input (AI system demo)

🧠 Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Workflow:

Data Loading & Cleaning

Preprocessing and Feature Encoding

Model Training (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

Evaluation and Visualization

Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

Single Sample Health Prediction

🏆 Results:

Models achieved high accuracy in predicting health categories.

Random Forest generally performed best after tuning.

Visual comparison shows the performance of all models clearly.

🚗 Minor Project — Automobile Data Analysis:

📘 Overview:

A beginner-friendly data analytics project that explores automobile data to uncover useful insights about car types, prices, engine types, and manufacturers.
It demonstrates data exploration, grouping, aggregation, and visualization techniques using Python.

🎯 Objectives:

Import and clean the automobile dataset

Handle missing values (if any)

Answer analytical questions:

Which cars have the minimum and maximum price?

How many cars exist with different body styles?

What is the average price by body type (sorted descending)?

What is the average price by company (sorted descending)?

Count how many cars have different cylinder numbers.

Create meaningful visualizations for:

Company vs Price

Company vs Cylinders

Body Type vs Price

Body Type vs Cylinders

Engine Type vs Horsepower

🧠 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Insights

Identified premium and affordable car segments based on price.

Found that body style and engine type influence car pricing.

Created intuitive visualizations for easy interpretation.
